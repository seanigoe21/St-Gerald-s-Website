This Web site is for St Gerald's DLS College

The Steps for using this website are the following:

Step 1: You should navigate to the top level of the project (SDN in this case) and then a green "Code" download button will be visible on the right. Choose the Download ZIP option from the Code pull-down menu. That ZIP file will contain the entire repository content, including the area you wanted.

Step 2: Once the .zip or .rar file has finished downloading proceed to open it by extrating it to a place on your desktop.

Step 3: Once that is complete open the "Index.HTML" File.

Step 4: From there you may proceed to look around.
