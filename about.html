            <h3>Welcome from the Principal</h3>
            <p>On behalf of all the staff, we would like to welcome everyone to St. Gerald’s DLS College. It is a great privilege to lead a management team in a school with such a rich history of excellence in teaching and extra-curricular activity.

                St. Gerald’s DLS College is a voluntary Catholic secondary school established by the De La Salle Brothers in 1908. The College is under the trusteeship of the Le Chéile Schools Trust and our enrolment is currently capped at 620 students. The mission of our Lasallian centre is to give a human and Christian education to the young, with special concern for the disadvantaged.
                
                St. Gerald’s offers a complete range of subjects with the most up-to-date facilities. A special effort is made to ensure that all pupils have access to a broad mix of scientific, academic, technological and artistic subjects. Our school has a strong academic reputation, and we are proud to be part of such a wonderful school.
                
                Our goal is to help each student on the road to becoming a ‘Daonchara’, that is, to be a humanitarian or philanthropist. We believe in the philosophy described in the Irish seanfhocal ‘Ar scáth a chéile a mhairimid’ which means, ‘we live in each other’s shadow’.
                
                We would hope that students who experience 6 years in St. Gerald’s would leave with a belief in the universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity. We will thrive and prosper as individuals if we can ensure that everyone prospers.
                
                Your sons’ personal well-being is very important to us and we will do everything to ensure that he is safe and happy. If you have any concerns about your son or you have any ideas on how we can improve our service, please send us an email to the addresses shown below.
                
                Enjoy the school year and all the excitement it will bring!
                
                Yours in Education,
                Shaun Burke</p>
